# Routes

A python project that aims to show a use for object oriented programming.

In this project I aim to recommend a pairing of couples based on their living address

a jupyter notebook with the maps can be found at: https://nbviewer.org/github/danihello/Routes/blob/main/Routes%20project%20Presentation.ipynb
